# Setting up a new React Project:

To create a new React project, open your command line (hit the Windows button and type `cmd` and then click on Command Prompt). This will open in your `c:\users\{your_user_name}` directory. From there, navigate to the source -> repos directory:

```
cd source
cd repos
```

Once there, run the following command:

```
lit-react
```

This will ask you some questions. For now, type no for data project and no for Layout page. Once that's done creating (could take a minute or two), the easiest way to open this in Visual Studio is to navigate into the folder of the new Solution that was just created. For example, if you chose the name "Foobar" for your solution, run the following:

```
cd Foobar
Foobar.sln
```

This will launch the project in Visual Studio.
